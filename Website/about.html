                <p>Gaming daily is a crazy hobby, but I love playing video games since I was a kid. It is a grate way to spend time with friends online and at home with family. My favorite genre are the FPS ( First Person Shooters) and especifically the Apex Legend  Battle Royale. I  get really exited to be the "Apex Champion" every round we go  and look foward to winning. </p>

             <p>Learning is a big part of who I am. So every day, I dedicate myself to learning something new. Whether in technology or one of those little things that serve its purpose for a lifetime. However, some days may be hard to remember if I did learn something new; I always try to have the perception of all I did that day and make sure that what I did know can be applied in my life in multiple instances. </p>
