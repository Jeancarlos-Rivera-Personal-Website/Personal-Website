                <p>Gaming daily is a crazy hobby, but I love playing video games since I was a kid. It is a grate way to spend time with friends online and at home with family. My favorite genre are the FPS ( First Person Shooters) and especifically the Apex Legend  Battle Royale. I  get really exited to be the "Apex Champion" every round we go I look foward to winning. </p>

            <h2>Learning</h2>

             <p>Learning is a big part of who I am. So every day, I dedicate myself to learning something new. Whether in technology or one of those little things that serve its purpose for a lifetime. However, some days may be hard to remember if I did learn something new; I always try to have the perception of all I did that day and make sure that what I did know can be applied in my life in multiple instances. </p>

            <h2>Anime</h2>
            <img src="Images/DBZ Gif.gif" class="Anime" alt="DBZ">
             <p>Anime has been one interest I have had since I was little. I remember watching some with my dad. At the time, my main interest was Dragon ball, and that was all I watched with him. I loved the memory of us screaming, thinking we would power up and turn our hair blonde. Nowadays, I shifted to something more modern like Demon Slayer, which carries a lot of action and swordfights.  </p>
