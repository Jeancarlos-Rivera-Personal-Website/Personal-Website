        <h1>Things I've watched, in no particular order</h1>
        <section class="anime1">
            <h2 class="anime-name"> Black Clover </h2>
            <div class= "p1"><img src="Images/Black-Clover-Poster.jpg" class="animeone" alt="black clover">
            <p>The series focuses on Asta, a young orphan left to be raised in an orphanage alongside his fellow orphan, Yuno. While everyone is born with the ability to utilize mana in the form of magical power, Asta, with no magic, instead focuses on physical strength. Conversely, Yuno was born a prodigy with immense magical power and the talent to control wind magic.
                This is hands down, one of my favorite ones. I often identify with the main protagonist and love the whole process of who he comes to be.</p> </div>

        <section class="anime2">
            <h2 class="anime-name2">JujutsuKaisen </h2>
            <div class="p2"><img src="Images/JujutsuKaisen.jpg" class="animetwo" alt="JujutsuKaisen">
            <p>In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed Energy (呪力, Juryoku), which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Unfortunately, ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, Noroi), a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These curses are shown as gruesome monsters, ghosts, and yokai.
                I like to watch this type of anime since I love everything that comes with supernatural beings, and if you were ever interested in how your emotions dwell within the ghost realm, this is amazing.</p></div>

            <h2 class="anime-name3">Demon Slayer </h2>
            <div class= "p3"><img src="Images/Demon Slayer.jpg" class="animethree" alt="Demon Slayer">
            <p>The story takes place in Taisho-era Japan, where a secret society known as the Demon Slayer Corps has been waging a secret war against demons for centuries. The monsters are former humans turned into demons by Muzan Kibutsuji injecting them with his own blood. They feed on humans and possess supernatural abilities such as super strength, powers that demons can obtain called "Blood Demon Art," and regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they are decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy known as Nichirin, injected with poison extracted from wisteria flowers, or exposed to sunlight. On the other hand, the Demon Slayers are entirely human; however, they employ special elemental breathing techniques known as "Breathing Styles," which grant them superhuman strength and increased resistance, helping them fight against demons. The strongest Demon Slayers are known as the Hashira and gain this rank by either killing a member of the Twelve Kizuki (the twelve strongest demons under Muzan) or killing fifty demons after ranking up multiple times.
                As stated before, this anime is and will be the one I cherish the most. Moreover, this anime got me most interested in the subject, so I started buying manga to read—Hands-down, which restarted my love for manga and turned me into an otaku.</p></div>
